# The Ruby Philosophy

This philosophy is often summarized as: "Ruby is designed to make programmers happy."

Human-Centric Design: Matz designed Ruby with an emphasis on the needs of humans rather than computers, which makes it intuitive and easy to read. It emphasises natural language elements, significant whitespace, and common idioms, so Ruby code often reads like English sentences.

Flexible: Ruby is designed to be flexible to allow programmers to have multiple ways to do the same thing. This gives you the freedom to write code that best suits your thinking process.

Consistent: In Ruby, everything is an object, and all of those objects have methods. This consistent, object-oriented approach makes Ruby code easy to understand and predict. Even basic data types like integers are objects with methods.

Metaprogramming: Ruby has robust metaprogramming capabilities. This means you can write code that generates other code, making Ruby very powerful and flexible.

Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas: Ruby features first-class support for "blocks" of code and makes it easy to pass these blocks around your program. This feature is heavily used in Ruby for handling everything from basic iteration to customising how complex objects behave.\
